First, we need to identify the context of the sentence. The term \"Mookie Betts\" refers to a person, specifically a baseball player.\n2. Next, we need to understand what \"scored on the power play\" means. In sports terminology, a \"power play\" usually refers to a situation in ice hockey where a team has more players on the ice due to penalties against the opposing team.\n3. Now, we need to determine if it's plausible for a baseball player like Mookie Betts to score on a power play. Since power plays are specific to ice hockey, it doesn't make sense for a baseball player to score on one.\n\nReasoning chain 2:\n1. Mookie Betts is a professional baseball player.\n2.

Tyler Glasnow is a professional baseball pitcher.\n2. Watching a pitch go by would mean he didn't catch it.\n3. As a pitcher, it's his job to throw the ball, not catch it.\n\nReasoning chain 2:\n1. Tyler Glasnow is a professional baseball pitcher.\n2. Pitchers are responsible for throwing the ball towards the batter.\n3.

It is possible for a professional baseball player like Mike Trout to hit a walkoff homer.\n\nReasoning chain 2:\n1. Mike Trout is a professional baseball player, specifically a center fielder for the Los Angeles Angels.\n2. A \"walkoff\" refers to a situation where a runner reaches home plate safely after a batter has been walked to first base.\n3.
