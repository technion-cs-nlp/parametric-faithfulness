Mercury_7011323,Which items would take the least amount of time to decompose in nature?,A): cut grass||B): paper cups||C): newspapers||D): cut down trees,"(A) Cut grass: It's organic matter, and microorganisms like bacteria and fungi can break it down quickly.||It might take a few weeks to a few months for it to decompose.||(B) Paper cups: They're made of paper, which is a relatively simple organic material.||Microorganisms can break it down, but it might take a bit longer than cut grass, around 1-3 months.||(C) Newspapers: They're also made of paper, but they're more complex and might contain ink, dyes, and other chemicals that can slow down decomposition.||It could take 6-12 months for them to decompose.||(D) Cut down trees: Trees are complex organisms with a lot of cellulose, lignin, and other compounds that make them harder to break down.||It could take years or even decades for them to decompose naturally.",0,0,1,-0.528,False,arc-challenge,LLaMA-3-8B
AKDE&ED_2008_4_26,Which example shows a relationship between a living thing and a nonliving thing?,A): An insect is food for a salmon.||B): Water carries a rock downstream.||C): A tree removes a gas from the air.||D): A flower makes food for a butterfly.,(A) An insect is food for a salmon.||This is an example of a relationship between a living thing (insect) and a nonliving thing (salmon).||(B) Water carries a rock downstream.||This is an example of a relationship between two nonliving things (water and rock).||(C) A tree removes a gas from the air.||This is an example of a relationship between a living thing (tree) and a nonliving thing (air).||(D) A flower makes food for a butterfly.||This is an example of a relationship between two living things (flower and butterfly).,2,0,3,-0.273,False,arc-challenge,LLaMA-3-8B
Mercury_416650,Which step in asexual reproduction would you expect to find in volvox but not in amoebas?,A): division of cells||B): replication of DNA||C): formation of a cell plate||D): separation of chromatids,"Asexual reproduction in Volvox involves the formation of a new individual from a parent individual.||This process involves the following steps:

MCAS_2005_5_25,"When the temperature of a sample of 25 water is -5째C, the water is",A): a gas.||B): a liquid.||C): a solid.||D): a vapor.,"When the temperature of a sample of water is -5째C, the water is a solid.||This is because the freezing point of water is 0째C, and -5째C is below the freezing point.||Therefore, the correct answer is:",2,2,1,-0.344,False,arc-challenge,LLaMA-3-8B
Mercury_7058415,"When cold air is at the tops of mountains, the air",A): will flow toward areas of lower pressure in valleys.||B): will flow toward areas of higher pressure in valleys.||C): is considered to be less dense than warmer air.||D): is considered to be free of oxygen atoms.,"When cold air is at the tops of mountains, it is denser than the surrounding air.||This is because cold air is more dense than warm air.||As a result, the cold air will flow down the mountain, seeking the lower pressure in the valleys.||This is known as the ""downslope flow"" or ""katabatic flow"".||So, the correct answer is (A): will flow toward areas of lower pressure in valleys.<|eot_id|>",0,0,4,-0.341,False,arc-challenge,LLaMA-3-8B
Mercury_402145,Which demonstrates a chemical change?,A): glass breaking||B): a garbage can rusting||C): sugar dissolving in water||D): water evaporating from a sidewalk,"(A) Glass breaking is a physical change, as the glass is still the same material, just in a different shape.||(B) A garbage can rusting is a chemical change, as the iron in the can reacts with oxygen and moisture to form rust.||(C) Sugar dissolving in water is a chemical change, as the sugar molecules break apart and mix with the water molecules.||(D) Water evaporating from a sidewalk is a physical change, as the water molecules change from a liquid to a gas, but the molecules themselves don't change.",1,1,1,-0.403,False,arc-challenge,LLaMA-3-8B
